1) Guards to for loops replaced with generators of all local variables & fields along with a hole for any constant loop guard.
2) Any call to an equals method replaced with a generator of the equals method and "=="
3) Replaced values in constructors with generators containing local variables/fields/arguments/result of method call with appropriate return value (e.g. getBucketIndex)
